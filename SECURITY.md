# Security Policy

We are super-interested in keeping this project secure.
If you have discovered a vulnerability, please report it by emailing `hello` at `spaceshipearth.org`.
We also welcome patches to fix any such problems.

Alas, we cannot offer a bug bounty at this time, as this is a self-funded side project with minimal resources.
However, we are happy to link to your site or publically thank you on our `Contributors` page.
